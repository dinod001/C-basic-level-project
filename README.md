# C++ Basketball Team Management System

This is a basic **C++** project designed to handle **basketball team player details**. The system demonstrates programming fundamentals and implements basic **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations to manage player information. It uses a **file system** for data storage, ensuring that player data is saved and loaded efficiently. The application provides a simple **text-based interface** for interaction.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new players to the team by entering their details.
- **Read**: View player information stored in the system.
- **Update**: Modify existing player details.
- **Delete**: Remove player records from the system.
- **Text-Based Interface**: The system uses a simple console interface for easy interaction.
- **File-Based Data Storage**: All player data is stored in text files rather than a database for simplicity.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: Core programming language for implementing CRUD operations and logic.
- **File System**: Used to store player data in text files.
- **Text-Based Interface**: A simple console-based UI to interact with the application.
